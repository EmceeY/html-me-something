		<h2> I. The Beginning <h2>
			<p> The space junk floating in orbit might have enough salvage to make the loan profitable, but only if the Old Junker missed something. Unlikely. <br> "So, are you going to take it or what?" <br> "I'm thinking." <br> "You've been thinking for three years." <br> That was true. Nothing in the junkyard had moved in as much time either. The once steady flow of spacers had dropped off. New Haven, the once shimmering ideal of terraforming, was irrelevant. New engines. <br> Nothing happened in the city anymore. No more explorers bringing back relics of ancient civilizations, no more stories of peril, no more talk about the distant promises of space. <br> "You're taking up room." <br> Crowley looked around. There hadn't been customers for three years. The Old Man was retired, he used to go up every six months for salvage. That stopped a year and a half ago. <br> Crowley couldn't blame the Old Man, they'd barely turned a profit with the mint space hab full of seeds that some zealous terafomers "forgot" in orbit. The seeds turned out to be useless, but the space hab had parts. <br> Barely a profit. <br> They made $1.85 and Crowley was promised credit towards a future purchase. <br> This was the year. Crowley was going to buy a ship that could reach orbit. <br> "You really won't come up with me?" <br> "No. There ain't nothin' up there. You know that." It was true, nothing registered on radar since. <br> At night when the sun was setting he could see, for a brief moment, a dot. It could be a satellite. It didn't exist in any sat charts. The dot had been there for the last year. It's orbit was stable. <br> Something was functioning up there. Maybe a ticket out. Enough salvage to afford fuel to a bigger hub. If Crowley could get a ship to a major hub he would find a paying job. The frontier always needed Captains. <br> "I'm going to lunch." <br> It was a Saturday. The Old Man didn't come back. Crowley locked up the shop and walked home. <br> No one else was out in the predictable afternoon rain. For fifteen minutes each afternoon at three p.m. (adjusted earth time) the rain began. After depositing exactly one quarter inch of water, it stops. Such was the excellence of the once awe-inspiring weather control system on New Haven. It was a scientific marvel. Now, all too commonplace. <br> Drizzly and routine. Crowley kicked a rock in the street, it skittered on the asphalt and splashed into the ditch. <br> "If you don't pick something I'm taking your credit to the grave." <br> Crowley picked up a model. It was remarkably accurate, rust included. <br> "I'll take it." <br> "Take what?" <br> "This." Crowley held out the model and smiled. <p>
			<p> Drizzle rolled off of the thick paned window. The small group that gathered on the edge of town to watch his ascent left for drier places. Most hadn't seen a takeoff since Crowley and the Old Man went up last. <br> "You ready in there?" <br> "Final checks complete. Ready for takeoff." <br> "Two minutes out..." <br> "Understood." Crowley borrowed a telescope after the impulse purchase and turned it toward the dot in the sky. It was massive. Ships that big couldn't run quiet. <br> "Blastoff in three... two... one! Godspeed kid." Each time was a sensation of pure optimism. As the world below lept away, the outer reaches of possibility beckoned. Crowley coordinates into the autonav. <br>
"Green across the board. Nav engaging in five..." <p>
			<p> The Old Man cared for all of his vessels well. Most would leave an old craft like the Centauri to rot. The Old Man kept the interior mint. She was rusty rusty on the outside. After a muriatic acid bath and several coats of thermal paint, she was ready for blastoff. "Ground we have solid course lock, we are going dark. Centauri out." <br> "Ground acknowledges. Don't be a dumbass up there. Out." <br> "Roger. Out." <br> Crowley wanted to approach the dot at an indirect orbit. That way, ground control wouldn't locate the dot. Also, if the dot had any defenses he didn't want to register as a threat. An indirect orbit at low speeds, similar to a piece of space junk, might not trigger any automated systems. Hopefully. <br> On approach around the night side of the planet, Crowley could make out the dot in the distance. The sun would rise behind Crowley in three minutes, handshake with the dot in ten. Crowley angled the nose of the ship towards the planet, if any defenses activated he could jet the Centauri into the atmosphere and burn off any projectiles before they could reach him. Last minute attitudinal adjustments would be difficult in a quick getaway. <br> Nine and a half minutes later, Crowley radioed the dot. It was enourmous. Three to four kilometers long. Crowley guessed the ship, if it were a ship at all, would take a crew of three to five hundred to operate. This shouldn't be in orbit. New Haven was one city, a launch pad, and five hundred residents. Any hopes of conquest were surely disappointed. There was no response to handshake. Crowley slowly matched the dots speed and orbit. <p>
			<p> Fifteen minutes later, still nothing. <br> After forty minutes Crowley had navigated the Centauri to what he thought might be the nose. Two massive doors slid open. Crowley nearly hit the auto evac. Every part of him wanted to run. Curiosity kept him. Crowley shone a spotlight into the opening. It was a docking bay. Doors wide open. <br> The Centauri glided easily into the massive hangar. Dot was definitely military spec. Crowley could see racks filled with torpedoes. There were no other ships in the bay. No lights. No one. <p>
